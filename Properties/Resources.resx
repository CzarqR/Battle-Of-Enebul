    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

However, the old man continued: You who brought me bandages, you will be the goddess of life and you will protect them. Turning to the next one, he said: You who gave me blood and lied to me will be burdened with a curse and you will be a goddess of death and war. At the end he turned his gaze to the youngest and said: You, because of your innocence and the fact that during the trial you stood on the verge of life and death, so that no emotion torn you, you will be the goddess of fate and justice. This is how three goddesses were born: the oldest was Rhae - the goddess of life, the youngest was Carthage - the goddess of fate, and the third was Faith - the goddess of death.

The three sisters left the house in the evening without saying anything to anyone and went to meet the wanderer. When they arrived, they found a sage. After exchanging greetings, he said: For your faith and deed, I want to give you a special gift. One that no one has yet received. He handed them blue stones, and when he directed them to the moonlight at his request, he uttered a spell. The sisters rose slightly above the ground. However, the act of the third of the sisters and her lie caused that the blood she tried began to buzz in her veins. Her eyes filled with blood and flashed with anger, and swords appeared in her hands. In a frenzy she cut the neck of her youngest sister, and when her blood dripped on the stone, a magical explosion occurred. The dust subsided and the frenzy was over. However, the youngest of the sisters lay on the road and the oldest sister wept over her. The stranger said to his sister who gave him blood: Did I not tell you not to touch the plasma?</value>

    <value>A long, long time ago a family lived in a village, parents and three daughters who took care of farming and sheep farming. One afternoon, when the daughters led the flock to the pasture, passing through a forest nearby, they encountered a stranger who was wounded and lying by the road. When they heard his voice asking for help, the eldest of the sisters ran to help the wounded, and her younger sisters followed her. How can we help you ? Asked concerned, eldest daughter. I am a wanderer, I walked this forest and wolves attacked me, said the stranger and added, I need three things from you, one from each of you. The sisters looked at each other and asked. What do you need And the stranger, turning to his eldest sister, said pointing to the path: On the edge of this road you will find a nest of bees, in the middle of this nest there will be special bandages, do not be afraid of stings, none will reach you, if only you reach and close your eyes, please bring them to me.</value>

    <value>He said to the youngest of daughters: Going into this forest, inside the dense purple bushes you will meet, a stone will lie. A white-brown goo will come out of the stone, take it and without looking behind, run here as soon as possible. And to his third daughter he said: There is a bowl and two swords in my purse, they have razor-sharp blades, take them and roll blood from the ram because I feel very thirsty and the water has run out, be careful not to let your blood fall on you hands. The sisters agreed and set out for the things the sage needed. When the oldest of the sisters met the nest he was talking about, they were surrounded by a cloud of bees, larger than those she had seen before. She came cautiously, and courageously closing her eyes reached into the nest, and when she felt the soft material gently pulled it out. They were bandages about which the stranger talked, took them and went back.</value>

    <value>Meanwhile, the youngest, walking in the dense forest, noticed the dense purple bushes, as the stranger described them, and when she entered them, she saw a stone from the story and mucus escaping from it. Remembering the words of the sage, she took the substance in her hands and quickly ran to where she came from. The third of the sisters, when she was waiting for her siblings, as requested, the wanderer reached for her swords and, having killed the ram while drawing blood into the bowl, and accidentally dipped the thumb in which she was holding the bowl. To prevent the old man from noticing what happened, she surreptitiously licked her finger and wiped it on the grass. When she turned around, she noticed the sisters who were running at that moment. Having got what the old man had asked for, they took care of him. The youngest of them smeared his wounds with ointment, the oldest bandaged them, and the third of the sisters gave him blood. As a thank you, the old man told the sisters. That they would come back here at the nearest full moon at night, and he would also come and repay them, and then hit the road.</value>
